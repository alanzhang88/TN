# TapNews Project

A simple simulation of Tap News

The website will keep track of the news the user clicked and will base on that recommend news with same type to the user.

The web server is uses react to build the front end and express to serve the backend.
The backend that logs the click of user and provides recommendation is done by python using tensorflow to build a CNN for news classification and time decay model to update users' preferences.
